# UMADS Capstone Project II

### jzupan, holdenms

### Fall 2021

Capstone Project repo with all the code and analysis used in project.

A few things to note:

* Make a copy of any notebook you want to play around with or use.  Notebooks are tough to source control when people are running other peoples notebooks.
* Always `Restart Kernel and Clear All Outputs` before committing a notebook.
* Do not commit the data (raw or cleaned) to source control.
  * For notebooks to run, download all the raw data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/umich-siads-695-fall21-predicting-text-difficulty/data) and save it in the `data` directory.
